		<h2>Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV</h2>
		<p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by \"devil\", I mean Robot Devil.  And by \"metaphorically\", I mean get your coat. Ummm&hellip;to eBay?

		<h4>The Cyber House Rules</h4>
		<p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Guards!

Also dark wizards. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Soothe us with sweet lies. Throw her in the brig. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
		<p>Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. I'll get my kit! It's toe-tappingly tragic! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; It must be wonderful. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>
		<p>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No, I'm Santa Claus!</p>
		<p>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>

I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by \"devil\", I mean Robot Devil.  And by \"metaphorically\", I mean get your coat. You don't know how to do any of those.</p>

		<p>Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? That's a popular name today. Little \"e\", big \"B\"? Soothe us with sweet lies. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Say it in Russian! What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</p>
		<h4>A Clone of My Own</h4>
		<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You don't know how to do any of those. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>

		<p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. And I'm his friend Jesus. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Yeah, lots of people did. Anyone who laughs is a communist!</p>
		<p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
